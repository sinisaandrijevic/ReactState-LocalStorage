# React.js State Management with LocalStorage
This repository showcases a React.js project demonstrating effective data persistence utilizing LocalStorage. The state of the application is preserved across page refreshes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The project utilizes React.js for dynamic UI development, integrates LocalStorage for reliable data storage and retrieval, demonstrates data persistence across page refreshes, and exemplifies best practices for maintaining application state integrity.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/sinisaandrijevic/ReactState-LocalStorage.git ``` 

2. Navigate to the project directory:
``` cd ReactState-LocalStorage ```

3. Install dependencies:
``` npm install ```

4. Run the Development Server: Start the Next.js development server with `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage
Upon opening the project, you will be presented with a page featuring a banner. This banner includes a hide button, allowing users to dismiss it. Once hidden, the banner's state is saved as "hidden" using LocalStorage. Consequently, the next time you visit the page, the banner will remain hidden, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

Additionally, a counter component has been implemented in this project. Users can interact with the counter by pressing the "+" or "-" buttons, which increments or decrements the counter value respectively. The counter state is also saved in LocalStorage, ensuring that even after refreshing the page, the counter retains its value.
